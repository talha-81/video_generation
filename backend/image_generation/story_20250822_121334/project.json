  "script": "A dense, misty forest glows with bioluminescent plants. A young adventurer, Elara, with a tattered cloak and determined eyes, holds a flickering lantern. Dark shadows twist among the trees, whispering Elara\u2019s name. Her lantern dims suddenly as she clutches it tightly, whispering a chant. The light flares briefly, revealing a hidden path lined with ancient runes. The shadows retreat as she follows the path. She enters a cavern where a massive stone guardian with glowing eyes stands. The lantern shines brightly, projecting holographic images of a lost kingdom. The guardian nods, and the cave trembles as a chest emerges from the ground, glowing with golden light. Elara opens the chest, revealing a radiant crystal. The lantern\u2019s flame stabilizes, illuminating the forest as she exits. The forest awakens with color and life, and Elara smiles, her quest complete.\n",
